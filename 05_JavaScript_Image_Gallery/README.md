### Things have been learned:
- The `toggle()` method of the DOMTokenList interface removes a given token from the list and returns false. If token doesn't exist it's added and the function returns true.

Syntax
```js
tokenList.toggle(token [, force]);
```

-  CSS `transitions` allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
To create a transition effect, you must specify two things: 
   - the CSS property you want to add an effect to
   - the duration of the effect.

If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
