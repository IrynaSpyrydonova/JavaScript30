### Things have been learned:

- The HTML `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics on a web page. The `<canvas>` element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

```html
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>

```
The actual drawing is done using the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface.
