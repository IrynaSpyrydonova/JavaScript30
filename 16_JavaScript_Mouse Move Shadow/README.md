### Things have been learned:

- The `offsetX` read-only property of the `MouseEvent` interface provides the offset in the `X coordinate` of the mouse pointer between that event and the padding edge of the target node. 

- The `offsetY` read-only property of the MouseEvent interface provides the offset in the `Y coordinate` of the mouse pointer between that event and the padding edge of the target node.

- The `HTMLElement.offsetWidth` read-only property returns the layout width of an element as an integer.

    Typically, `offsetWidth` is a measurement in pixels of the element's CSS width, including any borders, padding, and vertical scrollbars (if rendered). It does not include the width of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after.

- The H`TMLElement.offsetHeight` read-only property returns the height of an element, including vertical padding and borders, as an integer.

    Typically, `offsetHeight` is a measurement in pixels of the element's CSS height, including any borders, padding, and horizontal scrollbars (if rendered). It does not include the height of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after.
